# Game Chat App

## Overview

The Game Chat App is an interactive chat application built on the Flask framework. It is designed for gamers to communicate while playing games that lack a built-in chat system. The primary concept behind this application is to create temporary chats with a limited lifetime, specific to one game session. Gamers can also join existing chats using a PIN code.

## Features

- **Temporary Chat Rooms**: Users can create temporary chat rooms for their game sessions, ensuring that conversations are game-specific.

- **PIN Code Access**: Players can enter an existing chat room by using a PIN code, making it easy to reconnect with friends or other gamers.

- **Real-Time Chat**: Enjoy real-time, interactive chat functionality, allowing gamers to communicate seamlessly during gameplay.

- **Chat Management**: Gamers can easily manage and close chat rooms once they are no longer needed.
